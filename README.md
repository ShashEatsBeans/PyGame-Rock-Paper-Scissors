# Rock Paper Scissors Shoot!!
This is my first python project using a visual UI. This project was made using code I had previously made for a text based rock, paper, scissors game, and implementing the code to work with Pygame.
## Instructions
Just tap the option you would like to chose for your turn and the computer will play a game live with you. Play as many times as you want and close the window when your done to stop the program
## Installation
Download the main code file as well as the picture and store them in the smae folder, then open using preferred IDE software. This project is built using *PYGAME*, you can install it through their website or use the following command in the command window to install

#### pip install pygame
