# Rock Paper Scissors Shoot!!
This is my first python project using a visual UI. This project was made using code I had previously made for a text based rock, paper, scissors game, and implementing the code to work with Pygame.
## Instructions
Just tap the option you would like to chose for your turn and the computer will play a game live with you. Play as many times as you want and close the window when your done to stop the program
## Installation
Download the main code file as well as the picture and store them in the same folder, then open using preferred IDE software. The picture is not required but adds some nice visual element to the display. This project is built using *PYGAME*, you can install it through their website or use the following pip command to install

#### pip install pygame
## Reflection
Working on this beginners project has given me more skills in debugging code as well as getting comfortable with using different software combined with python in order to display a visual UI. I have also learned how to use PYGAME as a result of creating this project. This will help me in the future as I plan on making one more game before trying to challenge myself with a multi-language project
